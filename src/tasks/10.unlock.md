# Complete Withdrawal Process by Unlocking the Funds

Withdrawal in Godwoken is a two step process. The first part is initializing withdraw and second is unlocking the funds. Funds can be unlocked only after five day challenge period has passed. This time gives Layer 2 network operators a time to check and challenge the malicious transactions.

> Note 1: An Optimistic Rollup security assumption is that there is at least one honest node in the network.

> Note 2: It is possible that in future there will exist other solutions allowing for faster exits.

## Task Instructions

In this task you will use Godwoken Examples Tools Package repository to run the "unlock" command. It will complete withdrawal process from Nervos' Layer 2. Remember you can only unlock funds that you've initiated withdrawal of previously.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin on this task you must complete the [initiate withdrawal task](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction/tree/master/src/tasks/9.withdraw.md) and wait five days.

You can find setup instructions for Godwoken Examples Tools Package [here](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction/blob/master/src/component-tutorials/3.setup.and.use.account.cli.md#setup-the-godwoken-examples-tools-package).

### 1. Execute "unlock" command

Assuming you have met the prerequisites and created the account, you will have to execute "unlock" command using Godwoken Examples Tools Package.

```
cd godwoken-examples
node ./packages/tools/lib/account-cli.js unlock -r <INSERT_TESTNET_RPC_URL> -p <YOUR_LAYER1_PRIVATE_KEY>
```

Example final command with all the variables filled in:

```sh
cd godwoken-examples
node ./packages/tools/lib/account-cli.js unlock -r http://3.235.223.161:18114 -p 0x79682c20bbcaf7fcf18eb0c69b133c872227ceb88971090e7f2242c80cd54d18
```

> Note: The private key you pass to `unlock` command needs to be exactly the same as the one you passed when doing `withdraw` and previously `deposit`.

```
</details>

If you see message about transaction being committed eg.: "tx xyz committed!" then congratulations! 👏 You've successfully withdrawn funds from Nervos' Layer 2. They exist now on Nervos' Layer 1 and can be used there. You can also deposit them back to Nervos' Layer 2 if you wish.

### Potential errors

If you see `[INFO]: withdrawal cell not finalized` it means that you didn't wait five days after initiating withdrawal. You can see how many blocks you still need to wait by comparing "withdrawal_block_number" with "last_finalized_block_number". The first needs to be higher than the latter. You should see both of these values in the console output, eg.:
```
withdrawal_block_number 1210n { last_finalized_block_number: 1197n }
```

If you see only `[ERROR]: No valid withdrawal cell found` message it means that you haven't properly initialized withdrawal. If you did run withdraw command, make sure that the correct Layer 1 address has been passed to it.

If you see `TransactionFailedToResolve: Resolve failed Dead(OutPoint...` then please try executing the command again. It is a result of race condition but should finally succeed.

## Task Submission

To complete the tasks, you will need to submit the following materials for review by the judges:

1. A screenshot of the console output immediately after running the "unlock" command.
2. The Ethereum address that you've used for your Layer 2 account.
3. The Nervos Layer 1 address associated with the private key passed to "unlock" command. It can be found as "ckb address" in console output.
